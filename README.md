# React Native Mobile Chat App

## Objective
Build a mobile chat application using React Native, enabling users to engage in real-time conversations, share images, and exchange location data.

## Context
More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists,
communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. That's why many companies offer native
mobile versions of their web apps, or even skip creating a web app entirely.

## Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and interaction.
Real-Time Chat: Instant message delivery and updates.
Image Sharing: Share images from the device gallery or directly from the camera.
Location Sharing: Conveniently share real-time location information with other users.
Offline Capabilities: Access cached messages when offline.
Accessibility: Designed to be accessible to users with visual impairments.

 ## User Stories
● As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
● As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
● As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I’m currently doing.
● As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
● As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
● As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Features and Requirements:

### Key Features:
A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.
Data gets stored online and offline.

Prerequisites
Node.js
Google Firestore/Firebase

obtain the configuration code, and add it to App.js:
set up the database under build --> Firestore Database
activate storage
change rules to: allow read, write: if true
Start the expo project
npx expo start
Testing Options
download and connect the expo app on your mobile device
Android Studio (android)

## Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git

cd chat-app

2. Use Node.js Version 18
   Ensure you have Node.js v18 installed. If you use nvm, switch to Node 18 with:

nvm use 18

If you don't have nvm, install Node.js v18 from Node.js website.

3. Install Dependencies
   Install necessary dependencies by running:

npm install

4. Install Expo CLI
   If you don't already have the Expo CLI globally, install it using:

npm install -g expo-cli

5. Configure Firebase
   Go to the Firebase console.
   Create a new Firebase project.
   Enable Firestore and Firebase Storage:
   In Firestore and Storage, set the rules as follows during development:
   '{ "rules": { ".read": "auth != null", ".write": "auth != null" } }'

Add a web app to your project and copy the config.
Add the Firebase config to your project in the firebaseConfig object in App.js:
'const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN", projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET", messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID", appId: "YOUR_APP_ID" };'

6. Run the App Locally
   Start the development server using:

npm run start
